# FileBrowser
A primitive C# console application that allows browsing the filesystem. 
It can read files, play WAVs, change directory, list files, view the time, log commands used, list drives and even shutdown the computer.
It was basically a training ground for me to get the hang of C#, and this is what I made. Probably not helpful at all. :P
